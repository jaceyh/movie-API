# Movie API
## Server-side component of a "Movies" web application.
The web application will:
+ Provide users access to movie details, directors, and genre tags
+ Allow users to create an account, update their user information, add and remove movies to their Favorite's List, and delete their account

### This REST API is a Node.js and Express application built using MongoDB, tested in Postman prior to building the frontend portion of the application, and finally deployed through Heroku.
